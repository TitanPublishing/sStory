# sStory
sStory is designed to make it easy to tell beautiful stories on the web with a variety of media. It is meant to take care of the presentation and technical aspects of telling a story through the web, so that creators can focus on narratives and gathering material.

sStory is an open-source self-hosted solution so that creators, journalists, and newsrooms can publish their work online without trusting someone else's servers or terms of service.

* Easily stitch together sections made of photos, videos, sounds, maps and more
* Extendable, made to fit into pre-existing systems
* Supports YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud for embedding media
* Your story's structure is stored in hand-editable JSON
* A focus on beautiful presentation and interactions

## Getting Started


### Include dependencies and set up
**template.html** in the main directory sets all of this up for you so you don't have to worry about it.

You will need to include jQuery, Underscore, D3, Handlebars, Sortable, and Leaflet which sStory depend on. After that, pull in sStory and it's stylesheet.

```
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://underscorejs.org/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="handlebars.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="jquery.sortable.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
<script src="lib/leaflet.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="leaflet.css" type="text/css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">

<script src="sstory.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" type="text/css" media="screen" charset="utf-8">
```

You will also need a DOM element with the id of **#content** which sStory will use to fill the story.
```
<body>
<div id="#content"></div>
</body>
```

### Create your story list
The story_list is the heart of every sStory, and it is essentially an array of objects, one for each section. It is order-specific, with the first item appearing at the top of the page.

Simply create a new sStory and feed it the story_list array, and then render.

```
$(document).ready(function(){

  var story_list = [
        {
          type: 'locationSinglePlace'
          ,address: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington, DC"
          ,caption: "An address!"
        }
        ,{
          photoUrl: 'http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8315/8018537908_eb5ac81027_b.jpg'
          type: 'photoBigText'
          title: 'Making beautiful stories easy'
        }
  ]

  var story = new sStory(story_list)

  story.render()

})
```

## Section Types
### Photo
Photo sections stretch to fill the entire browser window (images will be cropped and display differently on devices with different aspect ratios). They **must have** a photo URL. They can **optionally** have a title or caption.

There are two types of photo section.

**photoBigText:** Which is for photos with no title, or photos with just a title.
```
{
  type: 'photoBigText'
  photoUrl: 'http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8315/8018537908_eb5ac81027_b.jpg'
  title: 'Making beautiful stories easy'
}
```

**photoCaption:** Which is for photos with a caption, or with a caption and a title.
```
{
  type: 'photoCaption'
  photoUrl: 'http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8315/8018537908_eb5ac81027_b.jpg'
  title: 'Making beautiful stories easy'
}
```

### Video
You can add video sections with embedded videos from YouTube or Vimeo. You will give the entire embed code to sStory.

**videoYoutube:** Add videos from YouTube by using their embed code. You can find it in the _share_ tab beneath each video by clicking the _embed_ button. You don't need to change any of the options. You will be given some code for an iFrame embed.

```
{
  type: 'videoYoutube'
  embedCode: '<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>'
}
```

**videoVimeo:** Vimeo videos can be added the same way YouTube videos are added. Simply add the embed code to sStory. You can find Vimeo's embed code by clicking on the _share_ button that appears in the top-right of videos.

```
{
  type: 'videoVimeo'
  embedCode: '<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/35912908?badge=0" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/35912908">FACETURE</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user9669590">Phil Cuttance</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>'
}
```

### Sound
**soundSoundcloud:** Audio from soundcloud can be embedded as well. You can find the embed code by clicking on the _share_ button in the bottom of each Soundcloud player. It is the iframe code labeled _Widget Code_.

```
{
  type: 'soundSoundcloud'
  embedCode: '<iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F99067369"></iframe>'
}
```

### Location
**locationSinglePlace:** A single location with an address and a caption. A leaflet map is generated with a marker and a popup with the provided caption. An optional photoUrl can be provided to add an image to the popup.
```
{
  type: 'locationSinglePlace'
  address: "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW  Washington, DC"
  caption: "An address!"
}
```

### Timeline -- COMING SOON
**timelineVerite:** Include a [Timeline JS](http://timeline.verite.co/) timeline simply by specifying a google spreadsheet's publish URL.
```
{
  type: 'timelineVerite'
  googleSpreadsheet: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApAkxBfw1JT4dFVxOEk0aGRxbk9URE9yeDJKMXNIS3c&output=html"
  title: "Antisec Timeline"
}
```
**timelineStorify:** Include an embedded storify by copying in the embed code from the *Distribute* tab at the top of a storify page.

```
{
  type: 'timelineStorify'
  embedCode: '<script src="//storify.com/ejfox/occupy-oakland-may-1st-general-strike.js" type="text/javascript" language="javascript"></script><noscript>[<a href="//storify.com/ejfox/occupy-oakland-may-1st-general-strike" target="_blank">View the story "Occupy Oakland - May 1st General Strike" on Storify</a>]</noscript>'
}
```


## Adding new section types
Sections in sStory are made of 4 simple things: the **section template** which is the handlebars template for how the section appears on the page, any new **editor input template** if needed, and the **section specification** which details for sStory what inputs a section has, and which are mandatory.

#### Section Template
The section template is currently defined in the story HTML, but should be moved to a separate file with the rest of the section templates.

Check this example of photoBigText's section template.

```
<script id="section-template-photoBigText" class="section-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
<div class="photo-background" style="background-image: url({{photoUrl}})">
{{#if title}}
  <h2>{{title}}</h2>
{{/if}}
</div>
</script>
```

#### Editor Input Template
Every section type takes different inputs, but they share many. The inputs currently included are **photoUrl**, **title**, **caption**, **embedCode**, **address**. If your new section type only uses these, you need not worry about an editor input template. If you were adding a new "person" section type, you might want to give it a "Full Name" input.

Check these input templates for **photoUrl** and **title** used by the **photoBigText** section template.
```
<script id="editor-template-photoUrl" class="editor-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
<p>
  <i class="icon-infinity"></i> <input type="text" id="editor-section-photoUrl" placeholder="Photo URL"></input>
</p>
</script>

<script id="editor-template-title" class="editor-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
<p>
   <i class="icon-dot-3"></i> <input type="text" id="editor-section-title" placeholder="Title"></input>
</p>
</script>
```

#### Section Specification
Section specifications can be found in the sStoryEditor constructor. There are 4 categories, containing objects for each section type. The *inputs* array contains every input the section could possibly have. The *mustHave* array contains the inputs the section must have to display.

```
@sectionTypes =
  photo:
    photoBigText:
      inputs: ['title', 'photoUrl']
      mustHave: ['photoUrl']
    photoCaption:
      inputs: ['title', 'photoUrl', 'caption']
      mustHave: ['photoUrl', 'caption']
  video:
    videoYoutube:
      inputs: ['embedCode']
      mustHave: ['embedCode']
    videoVimeo:
      inputs: ['embedCode']
      mustHave: ['embedCode']
  sound:
    soundSoundcloud:
      inputs: ['embedCode']
      mustHave: ['embedCode']
  location:
    locationSinglePlace:
      inputs: ['address', 'caption', 'photoUrl']
      mustHave: ['address', 'caption']
```
